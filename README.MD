name ,# of values,desc                          
                                               
-if,        3,      if a = b then c              
-xor,       3,      if only one then c           
-or,        3,      if any then c                
-and,       2,      if both then c               
-nand,      3,      if not both then c           
-xnor,      3,      if they equal then c         
-nor,       3,      if both are 0 then c         
-make,      2,      set a var                    
-line,      4,      use cords to draw a line     
-tri,       6,      use cords to draw a triangle 

for the logic commands they work so that if its true then it outputs the last value

a command needs a certan number of values and those will be presented as the command space value 1 space value 2 and so on

if you put = after a logic command then it will set the first value to the product of itself if it is true



***   this is a early beta i made in a day so dont expect too much.   ***



 I based the languege of of logic gates, reason being i already made them in desmos from  my calculator inside a calculator project. 
 Thanks for looking and dont lose your house!
